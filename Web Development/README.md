## Easy:

**Build a responsive card component layout using CSS Grid (with interactivity).**
- **Requirements**:
  - Create three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
  - The card should include:
    - An image (use a placeholder if needed).
    - A title (e.g., "Card Title").
    - A description (short text about the card content).
    - A button (e.g., "Learn More").
  - Use **CSS Grid** to arrange elements and ensure responsiveness.
  - Use **JavaScript** (`script.js`) to add interactivity, such as changing the background color, showing an alert, or toggling card details.
